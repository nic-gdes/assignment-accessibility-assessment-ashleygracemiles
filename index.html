        <p>Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud,
          independent creatures,
          self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned
          documentary, The Jungle Book.</p>
        <p>So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In
          this
          article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Types of Bears</h3>
          <p>
            Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear,
            then
            it
            was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
            Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in
            urban
            areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourange different behaviour however, as you'll
            find
            out below. The table below also gives you some useful facts about bears.

          <div class="content-3">
            <h3 class="section-title">Habitats and Eating Habits</h3>
            <p>Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other natually growing ingredients. In general
              they
              will
              hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their sustenance from
              farms
              or
              country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.</p>
            <p>Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other
              urban
              creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from
              readily
              available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has proven scarce,
              urban
              bears
              have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans, ready meals,
              and
              microwave ovens.</p>
            <p>Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonalds, to
              their
              own apartment.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Mating Rituals</h3>
            <p>Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest
              of
              their
              lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example with
              cave
              paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in the
              case
              of an
              urban bear.</p>
            <p>The following audio clip contains a fact file providing more details about bear mating rituals, along
              with
              samples
              and quotes from experts.</p>

            <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing
              little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all in
              a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.</p>
